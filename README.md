gen49
=====

Archival repository originally for work editing Geneva Latin MS 49, Jerome's *Chronicles*.


This archive is coordinated with parallel work on MSS in St. Gallen ([Kantonsbibliothek, Vadianische Sammlung, Ms. 298](https://github.com/HCMID/vadslg298)) and Bern ([Burgerbibliothek, Cod. 219](https://github.com/HCMID/bern219)).

When material from each of the working projects is validated, it should be integrated in the central Jerome repository: <https://github.com/HCMID/jerome>


Contributors should see the [project wiki](https://github.com/HCMID/gen49/wiki) for help getting started.
